## Frontend Technical Test 01

This technical test is designed to allow you to quickly showcase your skills in frontend software development. It should only take around 2 hours to complete, please do not spend too much longer on it, we do NOT expect a perfect piece of work and understand you may have to forgo best practice in some areas.

### Instructions
1. Clone this repo 
2. Install [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) v12
3. Setup [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) into the project
4. Install and setup a React based kanban board style component (there are multiple options online so feel free to choose your own) into the project
5. Using the image below as a guide, create a single page in Next.js that matches it as closely as possible in the allotted time. Feel free to use static, hardcoded data. The functionality of the actual cards is not important but it is expected that you can freely move them between columns.
6. Commit your work and share the repo for review. Good luck! ðŸš€
